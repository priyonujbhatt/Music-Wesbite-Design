    <h1> Current mental health and well-being situation</h1> 
    <p>The COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and social consequences have boosted the burden of stress that too many
        people endure, worsening the levels of mental health previously enjoyed and increasing the levels of suicidal ideation
        (SI) in some cases. As Ma et al. (2022) remarks, the SI rates increased among Chinese students during the COVID-19
        pandemic, where the mental cumulative risk played a central role compared to single mental risk and depression was the
        most influential risk factor for SI. It seems the restrictions adopted by some countries have had a big effect in terms
        of mental health. Wester et al. (2022) describes that countries with high restriction levels, such as severe lockdowns,
        increased the risk of individuals feeling depressed, sad or lonely in front of countries with lighter restrictions. At the
        same time, the feeling of loneliness among the older population increased.
        Other seminal studies as the one by Pandya and Lodha (2022), mention how university students’ mental health has
        been affected in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to the transition to online classes. Despite the fact online
        learning has allowed too many students all over the world to continue with their academic routines, on the other hand, it
        has also had a negative effect on a variety of factors. Regarding the author, the adaptation to this new online routine may
        have increased stress levels, headaches, backaches, lack of motivation to study online, or not feeling involved because of
        not attending in-person classes. In addition, pregnant women were another of the social groups that have been most
        affected all along the COVID-19 pandemic, in terms of mental health. Wall and Dempsey (2022) asserts that lockdowns
        during the pandemic amplified the stress factors that impact perinatal 1 women’s mental health.
        Apart from the aforementioned, the post-pandemic social and economic situation, the current climate change crisis,
        the war in Ukraine, the energetic crisis or the geopolitics situation in regarding to the Chinese-Taiwanese conflict, added
        to the hectic days and work routine that individuals suffer, appear as important determining factors that may increase the
        burden of stress that individuals suffer, increasing mental health-related illnesses. Because of the current situation, and
        with mental health-related illnesses predicted to increase in the long term, there exist the need of developing tools that
        will help face this problem.</p>
