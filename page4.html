    <h1>More Information</h1> 
    <p>Music seems to be an important public policy instrument to face or prevent one of the big challenges the society will have
        to face globally, mental health problems and well-being. As described in this study, high levels of stress can jeopardize
        the individual and collective well-being levels that have been achieved over decades, in too many parts of the world.
        The fast pace of life, the lack of disconnection from the workplace, the post-COVID-19 pandemic period consequences,
        climate change, the war in eastern Europe and its potential consequences on energy and food markets, or the geopolitical
        tensions generated by the conflict between China and Taiwan, among others, seem to appear as important factors that will
        place more weight on the stress levels commonly endured. In a way, the musical practice in its different forms may work
        as a stabilized factor, thanks to its contribution in terms of discipline, socialization, improvement of cognitive abilities
        -which can be reflected in academic terms- or brain functioning, among others, as described before. On the other side, it
        can be used as a medical tool for existing cases of mental health illnesses, other health problems, or medical treatments
        as described by Blichfeldt-Ærø et al. (2020), which demonstrates its effectiveness as an accompanying treatment in
        invasive cardiac procedures, or İçel and Başoğul (2021), who exposes that music therapy helps relaxation training in
        controlling anger and increasing sleep quality in chronic psychiatric patients. In other cases, as Schäfer et al. (2020)
        state, it can work as the treatment itself, whereas periodical musical listening works as a social surrogate, providing a
        solution to loneliness problems.
        Not only in terms of being a useful tool for helping in the treatment of various diseases, but music-based health
        treatments may also reduce the economic burden that governments and public health care bear, due to the excessive
        cost that many drugs and technology have, when treating chronic mental health illnesses. Music therapy is a worldwide
        growing field, in line with what Kern and Tague (2017) says. In this sense, there are a certain number of academic
        institutions as the Norwegian Academy of Music - which is working on the path of strengthening music therapy studies-,
        or the Berklee Music and Health Institute 5 which promotes research in this field. Renowned institutions such as Harvard.Medical School 6 have also pronounced themselves on the utility of music during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic
        to face the problems that have arisen.
        Music therapy is a growing field. Despite music’s benefits and contributions in different fields -not only in terms of
        health- such as economic development, or empowerment tooling in the fight against racial discrimination have also been
        proved over the years, there is not a big amount of high-quality open data that allows empirically demonstrating the before
        mentioned. Most of the scientific studies found during the elaboration of this master thesis, use their own source data or
        experimental data obtained for the case study. This fact hampers the elaboration of econometric studies that might deepen
        the economic research in music affairs. For this reason, there is an imperative need for national statistical institutes,
        public and private institutions, universities, or other types of organizations to collect data and create high-quality open
        databases, containing a wide range of musical variables -such as musical consumption, musical training, types of musical
        training, age at which the study of music is developed, music consumption levels for areas with different GDP per capita-,
        which will allow researchers in fields such as cultural economics work on this kind of academic literature. This at the
        same time may improve the quality of the public policy recommendations made by scientists and academic institutions,
        related to the utility music has for the whole society, and thus rescuing it from the lack of prominence it has suffered
        throughout history.</p>
