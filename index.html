        <h1> Influence of <span> Music on mental health 
            </span></h1>
        <P> Research shows that music can have a beneficial effect on brain chemicals such as dopamine, which is linked to feelings of pleasure, and oxytocin, the so-called “love hormone.” And there is moderate evidence that music can help lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol.</P>

                <h1> Positive influence of music</h1>
                <p>There are different mechanisms through which music may affect the human body, improving individual well-being and
                    mental health. In this respect, there exists extensive literature that argues in favor of different factors or mechanisms
                    through which music works on facing this kind of disease. One of the listed mechanisms is the one related to the
                    discipline and its effect on emotional stability. Discipline and daily stable routines prevent a life of highs and downs,
                    which may help to avoid emotional and psychological dysregulation, and slow down the triggering of depressive disorders
                    in the long run, or more acute mental health problems such as dementia or schizophrenia. Learning any kind of musical
                    instrument requires high effort in terms of self-discipline, persistence, and perseverance as Covay and Carbonaro (2010)
                    mentions, imposing a stable routine thanks to daily musical practice.
                    Human nature is known to be social, and in periods where social interaction has been drastically reduced, the
                    likelihood of occurrence of mental and physical diseases increases. During the COVID-19 pandemic period, social
                    isolation was established for different periods, where the probability of experiencing depressive symptoms and anxiety
                    conditions by children and adolescents, both during and after this time increased according to Loades et al. (2020).In this sense, the musical practice may help to face this problem due to its practice boosts social well-being, by instilling a
                    sense of belonging to a group in individuals according to Covay and Carbonaro (2010).According to Shipman (2016), individuals that spend time learning a musical instrument build during that span
                    period peaceful and relaxing moments, that help to escape from the stresses of every day, preventing potential mental
                    health issues in the long run. In her article, she explains how adults over 65 years old who participated in music playing
                    reported self-esteem. Following this line of reasoning, people who play any type of instrument send positive signals to
                    their social environments - for example through concerts or exhibitions, improving their social recognition- a fact that
                    plays against social isolation and potential depression condition. Thanks to music, students learn how to collaborate with
                    their peers. As far as they have to interact whit each other in orchestras or bands, participants improve their social skills
                    by staying away from the possibility of becoming isolated in life, and reducing the likelihood of developing depressive
                    conditions.Some of the potential mechanisms can be understood in terms of brain activity, where music plays an important role in
                    neurological rehabilitation. Music in its different forms, such as music training, learning, or listening has a direct effect on
                    some parts of the brain, helping to modulate memory, attention, executive functions, mood, or pleasure. More specifically,
                    music affects the dopaminergic mesolimbic system -the part that is in charge of regulating the before-mentioned capacities.and attitudes-, through the nucleus accumbens (Figure 1) according to Sihvonen et al. (2017). Patients that suffer from
                    neurological disorders, seem to be positively affected by increased levels of extracellular dopamine, as a result of the
                    activation of the nucleus accumbens, in response to music-generated intense emotional response. At the same time,
                    music-driven mood improvement and relief of confusion, help recovering cognitive functions, while helping to face
                    neurological problems and improving mental health. Not least, studies such as Särkämö et al. (2014) talks about the
                    positive plastic effects in terms of memory, for individuals that listen to music.
