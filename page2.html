    <h1> Contributions of music</h1> 
    <p>Ancient Greeks believed that music could influence body and soul, boosting some kind of stability, form personality, or
        give release from accumulated emotions. Music has been used since the earliest days in the treatment of chronic and
        psychosomatic diseases, and psychiatric disorders. Patients suffering from depression, used to be prescribed listening to
        dulcimer music. Not only for depressive cases but music was also used to treat hangovers caused by alcohol consumption,
        in ancient times.
        The ancient Greeks knew the importance of working in favor of a healthy mind in a healthy body, in order to achieve
        balanced physical and mental health Kleisiaris et al. (2014). They aimed to address both, the psychosomatic entities
        and the disease’s symptoms, through health care and psychological support regardless the origin of the disease was the
        body or the soul. In this line, according to the Platonic view, many disharmonious states of the soul promote mental
        dysfunctions, which can be treated with harmony and musical rhythm, thanks to music imitating the movement of the
        soul. Not only in health-related issues, Plato and Aristotle considered music to be related to the complexities of human
        nature and the perfection of nature according Schoen-Nazzaro (2012), where both agree on these four ends of music:
        imitating or moving emotions, giving pleasure, disposing toward moral goodness and disposing toward learning. In the
        same vein, Stamou (2002) mentions that in ancient Greek there was the belief that music had the power to affect people’s
        attitudes and thoughts.
        There is extensive literature that studies the positive effect of music on mental health. Studies such as the one of
        Rebecchini (2021), affirms how music intervention with patients with mental disorders, has had a positive effect on their
        mental health. Due to mental illnesses can be costly in terms of psychological care and medication, music could play an
        important role in this sense. Daily musicking, defined as a minimum of 1 hour of singing or playing a musical instrument
        per day, is associated with better self-reported health, than individuals that weren‘t musically active, according to the
        Danish study by Ekholm et al. (2016). In this regard, according to Sihvonen et al. (2022), pain research is paying higher
        attention to the evaluation of some music-based complementary treatment, which has emerged as an efficient tool in
        enhancing the management of acute and chronic pain. Sihvonen et al. (2017), had previously exposed that music-based
        interventions are emerging as promising neurological rehabilitation strategies, where a large number of studies affirm its
        positive effect on dementia and stroke cases.
        Apart from the aforementioned, music seems to play an important role in emotion regulation and works in favor
        of the improvement of depressive symptoms, and health-related quality of life in regard to Geipel et al. (2022). In this
        direction Clift and Morrison (2011) describes how a network of seven singing groups was established in East Kent
        (UK), which met three times per week; and demonstrated that group singing can have important benefits in boosting
        the recovery of people with a history of serious and enduring mental health problems. Depression is mainly treated
        by psychotherapy, pharmaceutical treatments, and electroconvulsive methods. With the main goal of assessing, the
        music-based therapies for treating depression, Castillo-Pérez et al. (2010) compare the effects of music on depression,
        with the effects of psychotherapy. They conclude that the group that used music therapy experienced fewer depressive
        symptoms than the psychotherapy group.</p>
